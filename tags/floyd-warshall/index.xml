      <description>Problem:&#xA;Please find the problem here.&#xA;Solution:&#xA;I started the problem using the a simple complete search of all path. Of course, we are not going to be able to enumerate through all the paths. But fortunately we don&amp;rsquo;t have to, once we have tried a path we can memoize the result as follow.&#xA;If I am at a certain node n1 with certain an initial time constraint T1before, and with time t12 I can get to node n2, recursively we know the best path to get to market from n2 with budget T-t12 take time T2after and has minimal cost C2after, then we have one best path candidate from n1 to n2 within time constraint T1before that actually spend time T2after + t12 with cost C2after + c12.</description>
